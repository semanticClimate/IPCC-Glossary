 - Creating the Wikibase / Semantic Mediawiki instance of the IPCC Glossary - Prototype #2
   - The following is needed:
     - URL address of the latest HTML output of AR6 Chapter outputs so that these can be imported into the 'setup' (Wikibase / Semantic Mediawiki)
     - Kolja Bailly to give instructions about additional markup if needed on this HTML
     - Kolja made aware of existing WB https://kg-ipclimatec-reports.wikibase.cloud/wiki/Main_Page and queries https://semanticclimate.github.io/IPCC-Queries/
     - Need URL of the latest IPCC Glossary source that #semanticClimate holds: This needed checking for accurancy as numerals were missing.
       - We have this example used in the October 2023 presentation: https://github.com/semanticClimate/glossary-demo/blob/279f5cc608b73efcc94a5ea33532603a3dc3c3be/html/index.html#L309 rendered here https://vivliostyle.vercel.app/#src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semanticClimate/glossary-demo/main/ipccglossary.jsonld
     - Kolja and Simon create data model for adding glossary to setup and create wish list for additional markup to be added to IPCC Glossary #semanticClimate holds
   - Simon Worthington to writeup prototype round description and goals - for sharing with communiity
